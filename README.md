Note on areas where the code can be improved.
1.Error handling: The code currently logs any errors that occur during the execution but does not
  handle them in a more robust manner.
2.Code efficiency: The code could be optimized to handle larger volumes of emails more efficiently.
3.Security: Ensuring that sensitive information, such as client secrets and refresh tokens, are stored
  securely and not exposed in the   code.
4.User-specific configuration: Making the code more flexible by allowing users to provide their own
  configuration options, such as email    filters or customized reply messages.
  These are some areas where the code can be improved, but overall, it provides implementation of
  auto-reply functionality using the Gmail API.
5.Time Monitoring: The code currently use randominterval function to generate seconds and in this code can be improved by adding cron jobs package to schedule email tasks
